This is a purpose-built Driver Installer for K40 Laser Cutters compatible with K40 Whisperer.

This is just a modified version of Zadig that has the singular purpose of installing the Libusb-win32 driver for K40 Laser Cutter controllers (manufactured by LIHUIYU) that communicate over USB using the CH341 chip.
